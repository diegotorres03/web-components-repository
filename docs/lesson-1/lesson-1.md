# Lesson 1: Introduction to Web Components
In this lesson we are going to work with some pre-created components to get you familiar with how to use and interact with components. 

To achieve this, we are goint to start by using some pre-created components, just to undestand from the consumer point of view how they work, then we are going to get our hands dirty and start creating our own componets.



So lets get started!
