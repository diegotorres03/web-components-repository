# Lesson 2: Composing apps with Web Components

In this Lesson, we are going to create [an amazing game](https://TODO url to end version of game) using only web components. Some provided by the lab, some that we are about to create.


Here we will explore diferent type of components based on their use and functionallity.
 

**Layout components** help up abstract comon layouts and help ups structuring the UI on our page.

**Data components** help up represent, store, query and visualize data with HTML.

**Event components** help us route and direct events so we can conbine, filter, transform and listen to multiple events.

As part of this chapter we will be creating the main component for our game.

**Sample of our end goal:**
